> This article chronicles my journey from a farm life valuing physical labor to a tech-savvy individual who thinks in functions. It details my initial exposure to technology, the pivotal moments that shaped my tech mindset, and the challenges I faced, including mental health struggles and a career shift to computer science. Through personal anecdotes and coding analogies, I share how I navigated lifeâ€™s twists and turns, ultimately finding solace and purpose in technology. Now, as I pursue further education and freelance opportunities, I aim to inspire others to overcome their obstacles and embrace the transformative power of tech.

## Small Roots: The Very Beginning.

/\*A great programmer I worked with once told me they thought in functions. At that time in my life, in college, it took me down a figurative rabbit hole of framing the way I think: about life, problems, and tech.\*/

/\*I didn't start in tech, believe it or not. I began as a Native kid on a southwestern farm, born into a family that valued agriculture over education. At an early age, I was taught to value brawn over brain, and by 15, I could haul hay and drive, had a developing mental health disorder, but I couldn't solve for x. I also got my first computer two years later, which touted the (then) spacious hard drive of 45mg of space.\*/

/\*For my first article here on Hashnode, I will frame it like a simple computer program in C++, my favorite programming language, because why not think in functions, or whatever you call it; a tech mindset, logic? For every twist and turn my life has taken, I will add a different function or for/why loop. (Note to programmers: please don't try to program my life, it won't add up to a working program, sadly)\*/

```plaintext
# include <iostream>
//This code is a preprocessor directive. This particuar code allows us to
//use cin >> and cout <<, which allows input to be taken from the screen,
//and output to be given to the screen. It goes at the top of every basic 
//C++ program.
```

## Input and Output: The Directive that began it All.

/\*Above I entered the first step in every C++ program's journey, including the preprocessing directive that will allow a computer program to perform at its most basic: allowing input and output. My tech mindset journey, began that fateful day when my parents decided to have me step out of farm life into the life of someone in the 21st century: they decided that, for my education, they had to buy me a computer. I will never forget that huge CRT monitor and the huge HP tower that boasted 45 MB of HDD, something I knew nothing about at the time. I just knew that for 300$, that puppy was mine, and I didn't have to write my diary on a typewriter anymore. That was my first preprocessor directive, one that opened my whole world of tech input and output. \*/

```plaintext
using namespace std;
int main(){ 
//This code uses the standard namespace and also declares the first function
//ever, the main. It's like the main story quest in a video game!All C++
//programs need this main function to execute, much like we need the 
//experience from our "main quest" to be a full human being. 
```

## The Main Function: Where the Tech Mindset Began.

/\*The year was 2002 and I was 17. I had lived a sheltered, dark childhood (details unimportant for this article) and I was tired of the endless cycle of life. Yes, at 17, I was tired. I wanted new horizons. I wasn't thinking of jobs. I wasn't thinking career. I was thinking of intellectual freedom. Windows XP was the first Windows platform I learned on and Office XP was the first Office platform on which I learned to type. I dug into the advanced system settings out of sheer boredom, for fun. I created documents, stacks of them, for fun. I learned to type. I had a simple program at the time that would send an animated boat full of rowers sailing if you typed fast, so I did that for fun and soon could type over 100 wpm. I built a website for our farm. I didn't know I was building future career cornerstones, I just knew that with tech, I was free.\*/

```plaintext
int TechSkills = 4; //declares the variable techSkills, which is how many
//tech skills I had at the time.
for(int Wow = 0; Wow >= 8; Wow ++){ 
    techSkills ++ //increments my techSkills +1 for every iteration
    break; //breaks after the first iteration to make my techSkill
           //count correct
    }
//This basic for loop teaches us a valuable lesson about the value of
//"side quests". In 2005, I began playing World of Warcraft, forever \
//sealing my fate as a gamer and increasing my tech skills every year 
//that I played. The variable WoW stands for World of warcraft, and 8 
//is how many years I played before the next step in my tech journey. 
//Please understand this code is for entertainment purposes only.
```

/\* Fast-forward to the year 2005. I had graduated from high school the year before and a lot of life had happened. I lived in Visalia, California at the time. I was both high and down on life and once again, needed an escape. What did I turn to? Tech. This was the year that Nimrodiel first began as an on-screen character. Before that, she was just a concept in my head as "the Lady of the Nimrodel", derived from my concept of Galadriel and the River Nimrodel, which flowed through Lothlorien. However, back to the subject of WoW. World of Warcraft. I had never played video games. Ever. Nimrodiel began as a level 1 Alliance Warlock. She would later morph into a hobby, a small online Facebook profile, and a virtual avatar showing others how to play Virtual reality (Yes, you can look her up on Facebook as Nimrodiel Nuine), but for then, she was just an escape. And escape I did. I played through Vanilla Wow. Then I played through Burning Crusade. Then I quit for a minute when life got hard and I had to focus on my first child, Evangeline, and then when the opportunity presented itself, I played through Dragon Souls, learning how to do heroic dungeons and raids, learning about stats and DPS. It was the time of my life. I was living my best years and I didn't even know it. I met so many good people and delved even deeper into tech. By then, I had an old server computer "boasting" an Xeon processor. \*/

```plaintext
const int divorce = 1; //const lets you know the number can never be changed.
                       //cause I will never do that stuff again.
int *Evangeline = 1 //declares a pointer to one kid
int *Walter = 1 //declares a pointer to another kid
bool college = true;
while(college == true){
    techSkills++;
  //Leah tries to write some code here to increase her tech skills.
}
```

/\*When that Xeon died, it did so with a series of postcode beeps that let me know she was dead and gone. Life had taken over again, and I was going through a divorce, and WoW presented another chance to distract myself. However, it was not to be. I needed to focus on me. I needed to figure out how to support my children. in 2013, then 1 and 5. I already knew I wanted a college education. I saw it as the only escape from a "life" of farming, fast food jobs, and poverty. I started a nursing program and felt so empowered. I'd be the first person to graduate from college in my whole family. I just knew it. I would make it big. However, the Good Lord had other plans. One day, after having to cut open a sheep's brain, I began reconsidering my options, as if there ever had been any. I wasn't cut out to be a nurse. My mental health, which had taken a turn for the worse, couldn't handle it. My stomach was weak and couldn't handle blood. I was socially awkward and couldn't talk to someone without having a panic attack. I didn't think like others, much less learn like them. I began to think back to that fateful day when I got my first computer and realized that was it. I wanted to shape that future. The future of me and tech. It had been there all along. I just hadn't seen it. \*/

## For Loop? Why Loop? \*For why? For Tech, that's why.

/\*So in the Winter of 2015, I began my journey into Technology and the multifaceted awe it inspires. I went to the advisor at my small community college and declared a new major: Computer Science. I barely researched it. I just knew. (Mind you, if you're a new student, don't do what I did. Please extensively research your chosen major before declaring it. It will save you untold heartache.) 13 years after the date my tech journey began, then I began to think career. Then I finally stopped doing side quests and started on the main story. (Yes, I am that kind of gamer, sorry) \*/

/\*If you come to the Hashnode blog, you probably aren't new to tech, but just in case you are, I want to tell you what led me to my decision. Artificial Intelligence wasn't a thing in 2015, that is, in the way that there were no AI-generated images or chatbots. It was a pipe dream in the minds of the greatest, and I wanted to be part of it. What was the best way to do that? To learn the basic building blocks that computers operate on. I could take everything I previously knew - and I knew the Windows system inside and out, I knew how to game, I knew how to type fast, and I could keep adding to what I knew until it added up to the Dream. What did I need to learn next? I needed to learn what made a computer tick. Literally. \*/

/\*In 2017, May 5 to be exact, I graduated in the eyes of no one but my 8-year-old daughter and the whole of Oklahoma City Community College, with my Associate's in Computer Science. I made a database and DBMS for Bill the Wiley Billy Goat, of which he had many tables and primary keys, I made an encryption program based on the ASCII numbering system, I made a program that could recognize numbers or Roman numerals, I knew memoization, recursion, pointers, and the difference between sequential access memory and random access memory. I could write fluently in four different programming languages, Java, C++, C#, and Visual Basic.\*/

```plaintext
for(lifeHappeningInstance = 1; lifeHappeningInstance <=10; lifeHappeningInstance +++){
    techSkills --;
    //During this time, Leah loses her bearings and may damage her skills in tech.
    //During this time, Leah goes through a lot but emerges victorious,
    //and is now writing this nonsensical computer program to you, to let 
    // you know she can still think in functions, even if it's just the main.
    }
```

/\*I

still didn't feel ready. And I wasn't. Life was to happen again, in a more profound way than ever. I gave birth to my last child, Kaiya, in 2019, during what was supposed to be a two-year "life break" in which I got married to the love of my life. However, the mental health difficulties that had plagued me all my life caught up with me and finally dragged me down to the bottom. I applied at Revature in 2020, and two days before I was to have the final interview, I had the mental breakdown of my life and wasn't able to attend due to circumstances. I will forever regret being able to chase that dream. \*/

/\*Life continued to happen until this day. I can't say my life has moved beyond the main. I'm still out here thinking in functions, trying to create a function of my own. Now I will say I at least have a side hustle in my chosen area. I am a web page Rater with Telus International. If you want to know more about what we do, or how to enroll, check out our community on Reddit or email me personally. I will include my contact details at the bottom of this blog. However, I have been spending the last few years recovering from the fallout that is mental health. However, after my disability was approved in 2023, 21 years after the journey first began, I decided to complete my Bachelor's degree, and for the sake of my family, will be earning my Master's from the University of Oklahoma. I am majoring in Cybersecurity for my Bachelor's. Applied Computing for my Master's this time and will earn my first industry-recognized certification this June. I am currently working on my SEO certification and trying to become a freelance tech writer. I am primarily interested in freelance due to certain professional interests not working out in 2019 while I was pregnant and disabled due to said interests being too rigid. Freelance gives me the freedom that tech always gives me, and maybe has always been my path. I doubt it always will be because I see myself working tech support or working on a programming project in an office somewhere, but for now, my interests are in freelance and bringing the wonderful world of tech to others!
